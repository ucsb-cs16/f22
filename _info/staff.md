* Email: Please use Piazza rather than email for course related communication.  You can send private messages on Piazza to either the entire course staff or directly to me. If you must email me using my email address (diba@ucsb.edu), please put `CS16` in the subject line, and know that there may be a delay in the response.

## Learning Assistants (LAs)
In addition to the instructor and TA, there will be some undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours).

## Learning Assistants in training (LAs in training)

There may also be a few LAs in training, students in course numbered CMPSC 100.  These students will be shadowing the instructor, TAs, and LAs during the first five weeks of the course to learn about teaching CS.  During the first five weeks of the course, they are not permitted to help (it is a union violation), only observe.  Please make them welcome, and respect their boundaries.  Starting in week 6, they will start getting paid, and will start helping with the course.
