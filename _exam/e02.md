## Format of the final exam

* The final exam will be held in person
* The exam has 2 parts, both are closed book and closed notes. 
    - Part 1 of the exam will be paper and pencil and will mostly test on concepts. You have 1 hour to complete part 1.
    - Part 2 exam will be autograded coding assignment and you are expected to type and test your code on a computer. You have 2 hours to complete part 2. You will submit your answer on Gradescope (similar to the lab assignments). **NOTE: To complete part 2 of the exam you must bring your own laptop computer to the exam hall. You can either type and test your code locally or connect remotely to the CSIL computers**: 
    
* You MAY NOT collaborate with each other. If the instructor finds evidence of cheating, she will report you to the office of academic integrity and you can expect to receive an F in the course. Students who offer help on the exam will be held equally responsible as those soliciting help.
