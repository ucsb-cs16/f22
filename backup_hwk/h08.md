By the due date ({{ page.due | date: "%a %m %d %Y at %H:%M"}}), please:
* Complete Chapter 7, including completing, or at least attempting, all of the participation, challenge, and lab activities.

If you find that you are stuck on any of the exercises, please bring your questions about those to the first lecture after the due date, or to office hours or lab (discussion section).

You will be given one addiitonal week to complete whatever you are stuck on, but given that we have a midterm on this material on 10/28, it's better to try to complete this by the deadline,
so that if you have questions, you can bring them to office hours, lecture, or discussion before the exam.
